Hello ðŸ‘‹,

I'm Ajay, a software engineer with 6 years of experience writing code professionally, and I truly enjoy it! Over the years, I've worked with a variety of programming languages, frameworks, and tools, including Go, Python, Django, and even some ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes.

Currently, Iâ€™m working as a backend developer with the great team at Couchbase, where I build cutting-edge cloud services and develop AI applications. Outside of my day job, I contribute to open-source projects, write libraries (e.g., [goenvloader](https://github.com/ajsqr/goenvloader)), experiment with new technologies, and implement protocols (check out my [websocket](https://github.com/ajsqr/websocket) Project).

This blog started as a New Year project, and here Iâ€™ll share in-depth posts about the things Iâ€™ve recently learned. Most of the content will be part of a series to dive deep into longer topics.

If you'd like to connect, feel free to reach out to me on [LinkedIn](https://in.linkedin.com/in/ajayajith) or drop me an [email](mailto:ajsqr.dev@gmail.com)!
